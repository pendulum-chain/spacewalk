# Building

From the spacewalk/client directory run

```
// standalone version
cargo build --features=standalone-metadata

// parachain version
cargo build --features=parachain-metadata
```

## Running the vault

To run the vault with the provided standalone chain use:

```
cargo run --bin vault --features standalone-metadata  -- --keyring alice --stellar-vault-secret-key-filepath <secret_key_file_path> --stellar-overlay-config-filepath <cfg_file_path>
```
To see examples of the config file, check [here](stellar-relay-lib/resources/config).
An example of the secret key file path is found [here](stellar-relay-lib/resources/secretkey).

To make the vault auto-register itself with the chain, use the `--auto-register` flag.
Be careful with the asset pair you use, as using arbitrary asset pairs will result in the vault not being able to
register itself.
This is because some thresholds for the vault are set based on the currencies specified in the runtime and these
thresholds are not set for any currency.
The auto-register feature takes a string argument with the syntax
of `<collateral-currency>,<wrapped-currency>,<collateral-amount>`.
The `collateral-currency` is the currency used as collateral for the vault and assumed to be an XCM currency, with the
number indicating its index for XCM that is configured per runtime.
The `wrapped-currency` can be either XCM or a Stellar asset, thus the format would be either just `XLM`
or `<wrapped-currency-issuer>:<wrapped-currency-code>`.

```
# Run the vault with auto-registering for XLM
cargo run --bin vault --features standalone-metadata  -- --keyring alice --stellar-vault-secret-key-filepath <secret_key_file_path> --stellar-overlay-config-filepath <cfg_file_path> --auto-register "0,XLM,1000000"

# Run the vault with auto-registering for the USDC asset on testnet (assuming GAKNDFRRWA3RPWNLTI3G4EBSD3RGNZZOY5WKWYMQ6CQTG3KIEKPYWAYC as the issuer)
cargo run --bin vault --features standalone-metadata  -- --keyring alice --stellar-vault-secret-key-filepath <secret_key_file_path> --stellar-overlay-config-filepath <cfg_file_path> --auto-register "0,GAKNDFRRWA3RPWNLTI3G4EBSD3RGNZZOY5WKWYMQ6CQTG3KIEKPYWAYC:USDC,1000000"

# Run the vault with auto-registering for the USDC asset on mainnet (assuming the issuer is centre.io)
cargo run --bin vault --features standalone-metadata  -- --keyring alice --stellar-vault-secret-key-filepath <secret_key_file_path> --stellar-overlay-config-filepath <cfg_file_path> --auto-register "0,GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN:USDC,1000000"
```

To run the vault with a parachain (e.g. Pendulum) you need to specify the URL, so use:

```
cargo run --bin vault --features parachain-metadata -- --keyring alice --spacewalk-parachain-url ws://localhost:8844 --stellar-vault-secret-key-filepath <secret_key_file_path> --stellar-overlay-config-filepath <cfg_file_path>
```

## Tests

To run the tests (unit and integration tests) for the spacewalk vault client run

```
cargo test --package vault --features standalone-metadata
```

To run only the unit tests use

```
cargo test --package vault --lib --features standalone-metadata -- --nocapture
```

**Note** that when running the integration test the console might show errors like

```
ERROR vault::redeem: Error while sending request: error sending request for url (https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/accounts/GA6ZDMRVBTHIISPVD7ZRCVX6TWDXBOH2TE5FAADJXZ52YL4GCFI4HOHU): error trying to connect: dns error: cancelled
```

but this does not mean that the test fails.
The `test_redeem` integration test only checks if a `RedeemEvent` was emitted and terminates afterwards.
This stops the on-going withdrawal execution the vault client started leading to that error.
The withdrawal execution is tested in the `test_execute_withdrawal` unit test instead.

## Updating the metadata

```
cargo install subxt-cli

// fetching from an automatically detected local chain
subxt metadata -f bytes > runtime/metadata-{your-chain-name}.scale

// fetching from a specific chain
subxt metadata -f bytes --url http://{chain-url} > runtime/metadata-{your-chain-name}.scale
```

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid spec version

If there are errors with spec versions not matching you might have to change the `DEFAULT_SPEC_VERSION` in
runtime/src/rpc.rs.

### Building on macOS

If you are encountering build errors on macOS try the following steps:

1. Install llvm with brew (`brew install llvm`).

1. Install wasm-pack for cargo (`cargo install wasm-pack`).

1. Set clang variables

```
# on intel CPU
export AR=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar
export CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang
# on M1 CPU
export AR=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar
export CC=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang
```

### Transaction submission failed

If the transaction submission fails giving a `tx_failed` in the `result_codes` object of the response, this is likely
due to the converted destination account not having trustlines set up for the redeemed asset.
The destination account is derived automatically from the account that called the extrinsic on-chain.

## Notes on the implementation of subxt

This section is supposed to help when encountering issues with communication of vault client and parachain.

### The runtime configuration

In `runtime/src/lib.rs` the `Config` for the runtime is defined.
These are the types that are used by subxt when connecting to the target chain.
Note that, although the `Config` types are all declared explicitly here, it would also work to use
the `subxt::PolkadotConfig` type.
This type is defined in the `subxt` crate and contains all the types that are used in the Polkadot runtime.
Using the `subxt::SubstrateConfig` type does not work however, because the `ExtrinsicParams` type does not work with the
testchain.
When encountering an error with 'validate_transaction() failed' it is likely that the `Config` type is not set
correctly.

### Trait derivations

It might happen that you encounter errors complaining about missing trait derivations.
There are different ways to derive traits for the automatically generated types.
You can either implement the traits manually (see the modules in `runtime/src/rpc.rs`) or use the respective
statements in the `#[subxt::subxt]` macro.
More documentation can be
found [here](https://docs.rs/subxt-macro/latest/subxt_macro/#adding-derives-for-specific-types).

```
#[subxt::subxt(
    runtime_metadata_path = "polkadot_metadata.scale",
    derive_for_all_types = "Eq, PartialEq",
    derive_for_type(type = "frame_support::PalletId", derive = "Ord, PartialOrd"),
    derive_for_type(type = "sp_runtime::ModuleError", derive = "Hash"),
)]
```

### Type substitutions

When the compiler complains about mismatched types although the types seem to be the same, you might have to use type
substitutions.
This is done by adding the `#[subxt(substitute_type = "some type")]` attribute to the metadata module.
More documentation can be found [here](https://docs.rs/subxt-macro/latest/subxt_macro/#substituting-types).

# This action triggers a GitLab CI job. The job first builds the project and then runs the tests.
# If the latest merged commit contains the keyword "release:", the job will also try to create a new release on GitHub.
# The release will be created with the tag "vX.Y.Z", where X.Y.Z is the version number of the `clients/vault` package.
